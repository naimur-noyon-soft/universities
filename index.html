        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>naimurnoyon soft. built the Universities App as a Free app. The service is provided by naimurnoyon.soft at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>For better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy. The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>

        <h2>Why does this app have ads?</h2>
        <p>Ads are shown so that your hard-earned money stays in your pocket. You've surely seen those paid apps around and you have to buy them to use them. You can find those apps in the 'Top Paid' section of Google Play. Those apps have no ads, because they get their money from your wallet.</p>
        <p>Making an app is not an easy task. It takes a significant amount of cost, time, and effort to make those. We admit that sometimes ads can be annoying and disturbing, but the ads allow the app developers to have something in return for their efforts and hard work. It also enables them to carry out their work to a further stage, making upgrades on the existing apps as well as creating new apps now and then. To continue developing free apps for all of us, we hope you will endure this little annoyance. Thank you.</p>
